# Motion Simulation Chair

## Overview

This repository serves as a link to the Motion Simulation Chair project, originally developed and documented on my school GitHub account. The project showcases my skills in embedded systems, electrical engineering, and programming.

## Project Highlights

- **Multi-Axis Motion Control**: The chair simulates pitch, roll, and yaw movements for an immersive experience.
- **Programming**: Developed using C++ and integrated with the FastAccelStepper library for motor control.
- **Collaboration**: Built in collaboration with a team of engineers, combining mechanical and electrical design.

## Key Features

- **User-Controlled Modes**: Allows for individual axis control and simulation modes.
- **Detailed Documentation**: The [PDF](MotionSimulationChair/blob/main/Motion%20Simulation%20Chair%20Final%20Documentation.pdf) in this repository includes extensive documentation, wiring diagrams, and usage instructions for our Motion Simulation Chair.
